# **Instructions**

We want to create a small application that will store (on the server) how many times a button has been clicked. This will require making changes to the front-end and back-end.

* Front-end: use jQuery to make a POST request.
* Back-end: add a corresponding route that increases the counter by one.
* View http://localhost:3000/count to see if the counter is working.
